 *	Lightweigh Java VM
 *
 *	Project is intended to provide a lightweight java virtual machine
 *	Main features are:
 *		- register based
 *		- application isolation
 *		- batch memory allocation from kernel
 *		- dynamic memory allocation inside machine
 *		- returning memory to kernel after garbage collect
 *		- dynamic garbage collector
 *		- 100% compatible with current java spec
 *		- continue running after program closed
 *		- prefetch resources
 *		- predict resource allocation (not lazy allocation like normal java)
 *		- resolve dependencies and load them once, use multiple times
 *		-
